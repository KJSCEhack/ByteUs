# Proposed System
- Making Identity documents using OCR and adding them on the Blockchain.
- Personal privacy and identification theft have been major threats to have plagued our government and society in general. To solve them, we will be putting your personal identifiers on the blockchain, encrypted and only visible to the people you give access to. Sharing on relevant information would only be possible if you wish so. Data would never be tampered, hence preventing creation of fake documents, passports, etc.

# Workflow
- Step 1: Create your user profile.
- Step 2: Upload your Aadhar (Identity document).
- Step 3: All your details will be auto filled, extracted from your         upload using OCR.
- Step 4: Your details are now added to the Hyperledger blockchain.
- Step 5: You can choose to grant or reject access to other users to view   your documents. 

# HyperLedger Vs Ethereum:
- Takes no Gas
- Inefficient
- HyperLedger 50,0000 TPM(Transaction Per Minute) VS Ethereum 1000TPM
- Immune to the 51% Attack

# Show Stoppers
- Tamper-proof private data
- Faster transactions per second compared to any other public blockchain
- Authentication without passwords or any centralized database
